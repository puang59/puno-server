### A big problem we face in our life is **information overload and disorganization**.
- Life is hectic, and we juggle multiple responsibilities. We use various apps and platforms to store our thoughts, tasks, and experiences.
- But here’s the challenge: These scattered fragments of our lives often get lost in the digital noise. We forget where we saved that important document or the details of a cherished memory.
- Managing it all becomes overwhelming: WhatsApp messages, default notes apps, and countless other platforms—each with its own system.
### How does puno solve this problem?
